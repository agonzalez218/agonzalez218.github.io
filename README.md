# Kiwis Codex

A Website I created using HTML, CSS, JS and a few templates from W3 Schools. I created this website to show my experience in web applications as well as create a website with my portfolio and resume.

There are three pages as of now: Home Page, About Me, and Projects

# Home Page
The Home page is an introduction to the website and also includes a cool animation.



# About Me
The About Me page contains my CV profile, including Skills, Proficient Programming Languages, Education, and Work Experience.



# Projects
The Projects page contains relevant projects I have created or participated in. I am proud of them and they show my experience and passion.
